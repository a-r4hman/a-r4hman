- Community focused Creative Computing - We advocate for more accessibility to computing and design for people from all walks of life regardless of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, religion, culture, age or background.

- Knowledge is power - Openspace is the future, we demand if and when possible to encourage openspace platforms and the *exchanging* of knowledge rather than *teaching.* Liberating designers of all backgrounds by promoting availability to learn how to work with, within and around tech. This attitude of exchanging knowledge that is beneficial to the growth of wider society should extend to all other subjects and fields of study for the greater good and development of humanity. 

- Communal Empowerment - We recognize that if we do not mobilize and uplift individuals and communities to become literate in technology and the language surrounding tech to benefit us and aims that serve our growth, then the elite will continue to use it against us, not for us. 

- Preventing a Technological Aparthied - We acknowledge that those currently spearheading developments in Big Tech are predominantly those of straight, cis, white, male, background are coding their biases into advanced technology and artificial intellegence, and that current means of sourcing, creating and selling technology is funded by 'modern' day slavery and exploitative conditions that promulgate late stage capitalist agendas. However we believe that through creating accessibility to knowledge of the inner workings of technology, computing and design for those of marginalised and historically silenced communities, we may introduce alternative perspectives on how to actualise an ethically engaged and socially conscious use of technology.

- Agency of Designers - Alongside recognizing institutional and systemic barriers in terms of fighting against the exploitative, unsustainable and consumerist nature of the technology industry, we also know that designers and other creatives play an intergral role in the development of technology. Designers today are too complacent and tethered to the idea that politics has no place in design. There is hope that we can mobilize the masses through education and the free exchange of knowledge through openspace platforms, this can lead the way towards a world emancipated by technology not further oppressed by it.
